# Why settle for outdated market reports when Next Move Strategy Consulting offers fresh, actionable insights?

I recently went through Next Move Strategy Consultingâ€™s report on the [Graphene Market](https://www.nextmsc.com/report/graphene-market-mc3134), and I found it genuinely useful. Unlike many reports that focus only on revenue, this one covers both value and volume, giving insights in physical units as well as financial terms. That dual perspective makes it much easier to understand market trends and make practical business decisions. Compared to other research firms, Next Move adds more depth and clarity without overcomplicating things. It feels balanced and grounded, which is exactly what I needed to plan our strategy.
